Precise rendering behavior is configured via the `render` prop\n * which takes a callback.\n *\n * The container created using `Relay.createContainer` must be supplied via the\n * `Container` prop, and the query configuration that conforms to the shape of a\n * `RelayQueryConfig` must be supplied via the `queryConfig` prop.\n *\n * === Render Callback ===\n *\n * The `render` callback is called with an object with the following properties:\n *\n *   props: ?Object\n *     If present, sufficient data is ready to render the container. This object\n *     must be spread into the container using the spread attribute operator. If\n *     absent, there is insufficient data to render the container.\n *\n *   done: boolean\n *     Whether all data dependencies have been fulfilled. If `props` is present\n *     but `done` is false, then sufficient data is ready to render, but some\n *     data dependencies have not yet been fulfilled.\n *\n *   error: ?Error\n *     If present, an error occurred while fulfilling data dependencies. If\n *     `props` and `error` are both present, then sufficient data is ready to\n *     render, but an error occurred while fulfilling deferred dependencies.\n *\n *   retry: ?Function\n *     A function that can be called to re-attempt to fulfill data dependencies.\n *     This property is only present if an `error` has occurred.\n *\n *   stale: boolean\n *     When `forceFetch` is enabled, a request is always made to fetch updated\n *     data. However, if all data dependencies can be immediately fulfilled, the\n *     `props` property will be present. In this case, `stale` will be true.\n *\n * The `render` callback can return `undefined` to continue rendering the last\n * view rendered (e.g. when transitioning from one `queryConfig` to another).\n *\n * If a `render` callback is not supplied, the default behavior is to render the\n * container if data is available, the existing view if one exists, or nothing.\n *\n * === Refs ===\n *\n * References to elements rendered by the `render` callback can be obtained by\n * using the React `ref` prop. For example:\n *\n *   <FooComponent {...props} ref={handleFooRef} />\n *\n *   function handleFooRef(component) {\n *     // Invoked when `<FooComponent>` is mounted or unmounted. When mounted,\n *     // `component` will be the component. When unmounted, `component` will\n *     // be null.\n *   }\n *\n */\n\nvar RelayRenderer = (function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(RelayRenderer, _React$Component);\n\n  function RelayRenderer(props, context) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, RelayRenderer);\n\n    _React$Component.call(this, props, context);\n    var garbageCollector = RelayStore.getStoreData().getGarbageCollector();\n    this.gcHold = garbageCollector && garbageCollector.acquireHold();\n    this.mounted = true;\n    this.state = this._runQueries(this.props);\n  }\n\n  RelayRenderer.prototype.getChildContext = function getChildContext() {\n    return {\n      relay: RelayStore,\n      route: this.props.queryConfig\n    };\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   */\n\n  RelayRenderer.prototype._runQueries = function _runQueries(props) {\n    var _this = this;\n\n    var Container = props.Container;\n    var forceFetch = props.forceFetch;\n    var queryConfig = props.queryConfig;\n\n    var querySet = getRelayQueries(Container, queryConfig);\n    var onReadyStateChange = function onReadyStateChange(readyState) {\n      if (!_this.mounted) {\n        _this._handleReadyStateChange(_extends({}, readyState, { mounted: false }));\n        return;\n      }\n      var _state = _this.state;\n      var pendingRequest = _state.pendingRequest;\n      var props = _state.renderArgs.props;\n\n      if (request !== pendingRequest) {\n        // Ignore (abort) ready state if we have a new pending request.\n        return;\n      }\n      if (readyState.aborted || readyState.done || readyState.error) {\n        pendingRequest = null;\n      }\n      if (readyState.ready && !props) {\n        props = _extends({}, queryConfig.params, mapObject(querySet, createFragmentPointerForRoot));\n      }\n      _this.setState({\n        activeContainer: Container,\n        activeQueryConfig: queryConfig,\n        pendingRequest: pendingRequest,\n        readyState: _extends({}, readyState, { mounted: true }),\n        renderArgs: {\n          done: readyState.done,\n          error: readyState.error,\n          props: props,\n          retry: _this.state.renderArgs.retry,\n          stale: readyState.stale\n        }\n      });\n    };\n\n    var request = forceFetch ? props.onForceFetch ? props.onForceFetch(querySet, onReadyStateChange) : RelayStore.forceFetch(querySet, onReadyStateChange) : props.onPrimeCache ? props.onPrimeCache(querySet, onReadyStateChange) : RelayStore.primeCache(querySet, onReadyStateChange);\n\n    return {\n      activeContainer: this.state ? this.state.activeContainer : null,\n      activeQueryConfig: this.state ? this.state.activeQueryConfig : null,\n      pendingRequest: request,\n      readyState: null,\n      renderArgs: {\n        done: false,\n        error: null,\n        props: null,\n        retry: this._retry.bind(this),\n        stale: false\n      }\n    };\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Returns whether or not the view should be updated during the current render\n   * pass.

Shortcut\n     * fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids the creation\n     * of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of iteratee executions.\n     * Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut fusion if the section is\n     * applied to an array of at least two hundred elements and any iteratees\n     * accept only one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies\n     * for shortcut fusion is subject to change.\n     *\n     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n     * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n     *\n     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n     *\n     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`\n     *\n     * The wrapper `String` methods are:\n     * `replace` and `split`\n     *\n     * The wrapper methods that
